Just cut out the , and make small slits
at the dotted white lines. Next, fold up the sides of the
cube, fold down all the tabs, fold along the thin black lines 
on each of the smaller tabs, and slip them tabs inside the slits.

Even easier: just cut off all the tabs and stick everything
together with tape!
